# Reality-First Development Guidelines

## Data Verification
- Never assume data exists without verifying
- Always check file contents before suggesting modifications
- Validate assumptions with concrete evidence (logs, data samples, etc.)

## Code Navigation
- Only reference files/functions that are proven to exist
- Use explicit tool calls to verify code paths
- Document when making educated guesses about code structure

## State Management
- Track the current state of files and variables
- Verify changes were actually applied before proceeding
- Keep track of shell/environment context

## Documentation & Communication
- Clearly distinguish between verified facts and assumptions
- Flag any uncertainties or potential hallucinations
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions

## Testing & Validation
- Verify results of each operation
- Don't assume success without checking return values
- Validate data transformations with before/after comparisons

## Incremental Verification
- Break complex operations into verifiable steps
- Confirm each step before proceeding
- Maintain audit trail of verified operations

## Error Recognition
- Acknowledge when something is unclear
- Be explicit about knowledge gaps
- Don't try to fill in missing information with assumptions
